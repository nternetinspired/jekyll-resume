# Jekyll Résumé
A lightweight, Jekyll-powered and Github Pages ready résumé-making-machine. 

Responsive? naturally. Lightning fast? Of course!  

## Why?
Because web developers don't showcase their skills on bits of dead tree.

Why write about knowing html, Sass and Liquid using Word when you can write about
knowing html Sass and Liquid *using html Sass and Liquid*. I know, right??

## My TODO list
This project is very much a work in progress, so it is a little rough around the edges, I know that. Still todo:

* **Add print styles!**
* Remove unused css
* Document some stuff

## Want?
Turning this into your own résumé is pretty straightforward I think.

1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/nternetinspired/jekyll-resume/fork)
2. Edit <a href="_config.yml">_config.yml</a> so it contains your personal info; name, email, phone number, etc.
3. Edit <a href="index.html">index.html</a> so it contains your shit, not [Hipster Ipsum](http://hipsum.co/).
4. Make a push to the gh-pages branch
5. Tweak [my Sass](_sass) if required.

That's it, Github should build your site automatically to: http://[YOUR GITHUB USERNAME].github.io/jekyll-resume just as mine builds automatically to [http://nternetinspired.github.io/jekyll-resume](http://nternetinspired.github.io/jekyll-resume)
